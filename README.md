## Narrative

Alex, a busy professional, slumps at their desk after a tense phone call that left them simmering with frustration. Normally, they’d stew in silence or vent, but today they search “quick anger fix” and discover a web page promising calm in just two minutes—no download, no sign up, just a single button: "Calm Down."

Curious but annoyed, Alex clicks. Soothing colors and a serene image fill the screen. A wry line of text appears: “First, take a deep breath—not a dramatic sigh, just a breath.” With each new gentle prompt, Alex finds their jaw unclenching. A virtual image of a riverbank replaces their monitor’s cold glow. The session offers small nudges—“Notice your feet on the floor”—all in a light, almost conspiratorial tone that avoids condescension.

Two minutes later, Alex is asked: “How are you feeling now?” They click “Feeling Calmer!” and realize their pulse has slowed. The anger hasn't disappeared, but it feels manageable again. Alex shuts the laptop and goes on with their day—impressed that so small a thing could make a difference, grateful for a tool that respected their feelings and time.

Their journey is mirrored by thousands: whether a parent after a toddler’s meltdown, a student reeling from a grade, or anyone in need of a ‘pause’—all return more composed, helping themselves and those around them.
